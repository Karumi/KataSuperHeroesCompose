![Karumi logo][karumilogo] KataSuperHeroes with Jetpack Compose [![Build, lint, and test](https://github.com/Karumi/KataSuperHeroesCompose/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Karumi/KataSuperHeroesCompose/actions/workflows/build.yml)
============================

- We are here to learn about [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).
- We are going to use [Jetpack Compose Testing Tools](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/testing) to interact with the Application UI from our tests.
- We are going to use [Shot](https://github.com/karumi/Shot) test our UI using Screenshot Testing.
- We are going to use [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) to replace production code with [Test Doubles][testDoubles].
- We are going to practice pair programming.

## Getting started

This repository contains an Android application to show super heroes information:

![ApplicationScreencast][applicationScreencast]

This Application is based on Jetpack Compose components and Jetpack View Models:

* ``SuperHeroListScreen`` showing a list of super heroes with name, photo and a special badge if is part of the Avengers Team.

![MainActivityScreenshot][mainActivityScreenshot]

* ``SuperHeroDetailScreen`` showing detailed information about a super hero like his or her name, photo and description.

![SuperHeroDetailActivityScreenshot][superHeroDetailActivityScreenshot]

The application architecture, dependencies and configuration is ready to just start working with view models, Hilt as dependency injector and Jetpack Compose for the UI.

## Tasks

1. UI Development:

Your task as an Android Developer is to **write all the missing components**  needed to implement this Application UI. Navigation and the main skeleton is in place, but you'll have to implement some Jetpack Compose components using the assets provided. ``main`` branch will be used as the solution and ``write-ui`` branch will be used as your starting point.

2. Writing tests:

Your task as Android Developer is to **write all the UI tests** needed to check if the Application UI is working as expected. ``main`` branch will be used as the solution and ``write-tests`` branch will be used as your starting point.

## Extra Tasks

If you are done and you want to keep practicing, try to continue with the following tasks:

* Modify the detail screen to handle an error case where the name of the super hero used to start this activity does not exist and show a message if this happens.
* Modify the project to handle connection errors and show a message explaining that something went wrong in both screens.
* Add coverage to all the new scenarios.
